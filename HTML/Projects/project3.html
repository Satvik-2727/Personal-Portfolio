            <span class="descriptioncontent">This is my Text-Coder-Decoder project made out of Python.In this you can either code your words in the pattern or decode the words which are coded in that pattern. The pattern used in this project to code english text is: </span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="descriptioncontent pattern">
                Pattern (who want to understand the program) : <br><br> When a word or sentence  is given as input let's assume "I like dosa". Here, the program would divide each word in the sentence and store it in a list like this : ["I","like","dosa"]. Then the program would go through each word in a for loop, where it would go through an if statement. If the length of the word is less than or equal to three, then it would just change the word by reversing it. If not , then it would take the first letter from the word and put it at the last and add three random words at the starting and the ending of the word. So the output of the given text would be "I xytikelqwe ierosadngd".
